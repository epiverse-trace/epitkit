<h2 id="mathematical-model-of-infectious-diseases">Mathematical Model of Infectious Diseases<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mathematical-model-of-infectious-diseases"></a></h2>
<p>A mathematical model in the epidemic theory of infectious diseases is
an abstract representation that uses mathematical equations and
algorithms to describe the dynamics of infection spread within a
population. These models allow for understanding, predicting, or
projecting how an infectious disease can spread and affect a community,
considering various factors such as the transmission rate, infectious
period, recovery, and immunity.</p>
<p>The classic mathematical model is the SIR model: Susceptible,
Infectious, and Recovered. This traditionally uses ordinary differential
equations (ODEs).</p>
<p>There are several types of mathematical models, the most common
being: <a href="#deterministic-model">deterministic</a> and <a href="#stochastic-model">stochastic</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="ordinary-differential-equations-odes">Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ordinary-differential-equations-odes"></a></h2>
<p>Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be used to represent the
rate of change of one variable (e.g., the number of infected
individuals) with respect to another (e.g., time). ODEs are widely used
in infectious disease modeling to model the flow of individuals between
different disease states.</p>
<p>For more information, consult this introduction to <a href="https://mathinsight.org/ordinary_differential_equation_introduction" class="external-link">ODEs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="deterministic-model">Deterministic Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deterministic-model"></a></h2>
<p>A deterministic model is a type of mathematical model in which the
behavior of the system is completely determined by its initial
conditions and model parameters, without involving elements of
randomness or uncertainty. In other words, given a set of initial
conditions and parameters, the model will always produce the same
results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="stochastic-model">Stochastic Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stochastic-model"></a></h2>
<p>A stochastic model addresses the random variation of parameters in
model simulations for the same initial conditions. This means that the
exact same results will not always be obtained in all simulations.
Examples include stochastic differential equations and branching process
models. For more details, consult <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042716300495?via%3Dihub" class="external-link">Allen
(2017)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="initial-conditions">Initial Conditions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#initial-conditions"></a></h2>
<p>In Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), initial conditions are the
values of each compartment at the initial time of the model (time zero).
These conditions are necessary to start the simulation of the epidemic
in the model and can significantly affect subsequent results.</p>
<p>Example: If there is one infectious individual in a population of
1000 in a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model, the initial conditions
would be: * <span class="math inline">\(S_0=999\)</span> * <span class="math inline">\(I_0=1\)</span> * <span class="math inline">\(R_0=0\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="transmission-model-parameters">Transmission Model Parameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#transmission-model-parameters"></a></h2>
<p>Model parameters are values that allow the movement of individuals
between different compartments; they describe the flow between disease
states. These include, for example: the recovery rate which is a model
parameter that can be used to describe the flow between infectious and
recovered states.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="state-variables">State Variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#state-variables"></a></h2>
<p>State variables in a model represented by ordinary differential
equations are the disease states in which individuals can be. For
example, if individuals can be susceptible, infectious, or recovered,
the state variables are S, I, and R. There is an ordinary differential
equation for each state variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="susceptible">Susceptible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#susceptible"></a></h2>
<p>Population with no prior or current exposure to the pathogen, or
without vaccination, and therefore having neither infection nor humoral
immune protection (neutralizing antibodies) against the pathogen.
(Related to state variables)</p>
<p>Examples: * In 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
entire world population was considered susceptible. * Children not
vaccinated against measles and who have not been infected or have not
developed post-infection antibodies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="infectious">Infectious<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#infectious"></a></h2>
<p>Population with active presence of the pathogen capable of
transmitting it to susceptible individuals in the population. This state
has a duration equivalent to the infectious period.</p>
<p>Example: * Patient living with HIV not receiving antiretroviral
treatment with a high viral load who has unprotected sex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="recovered">Recovered<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recovered"></a></h2>
<p>Population with neutralizing antibodies against the pathogen. This
immunity could have been acquired via natural infection or vaccination.
This state has a duration equivalent to the period of neutralizing
immunity duration. (Related to state variables)</p>
<p>Example: * Person vaccinated against yellow fever. This vaccine
provides high, long-lasting protection against the infection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="exposed">Exposed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exposed"></a></h2>
<p>Population that has been infected with a pathogen but is not yet
capable of transmitting the infection (infected, but not infectious).
This state has a duration equivalent to the latency period.</p>
<p>Example: * The transmission of the tuberculosis bacillus occurs from
positive bacilliferous subjects who release bacilli into the
environment, and exposed individuals are easily infected. However, for
many years individuals can remain infected but controlling the disease,
without transmitting it; these individuals are considered exposed in
dynamic transmission models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="spillover">Spillover<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spillover"></a></h2>
<p>In epidemiology, the term spillover refers to the process by which a
pathogen (microorganism, whether virus, bacterium, parasite, or other),
which normally affects a specific animal species, is transmitted to
another reservoir. In other words, it is the evolutionary leap of a
pathogen between species, which includes transmission from an animal to
a human.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="zoonosis">Zoonosis<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zoonosis"></a></h2>
<p>PAHO defines zoonosis as “infectious diseases naturally transmissible
from vertebrate animals to humans”.</p>

<h2 id="basic-reproduction-number-r_0">Basic Reproduction Number, <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-reproduction-number-r_0"></a></h2>
<p>It is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced from
a primary case in a totally susceptible population, i.e., at time 0.
This number is specific to each infectious agent, although it can also
be affected by climatic and social variables, and represents the
transmission potential of the pathogen. This value is theoretical and
also determines the herd immunity threshold. It is a measure of the
transmissibility of an infection. It is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_0 = p * c * D\)</span></p>
<p>Where, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = probability of
infection after contact <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> = contact
rate <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> = duration of the infectious
period</p>
<p>Example: * The following diagram compares the <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> of seasonal influenza, Ebola,
Diphtheria, Smallpox, and Measles respiratory syndrome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="effective-reproduction-number-r_t">Effective Reproduction Number, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>
<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#effective-reproduction-number-r_t"></a></h2>
<p>It is defined as the average number of secondary cases from an
infectious case in the population composed of susceptible and
non-susceptible hosts per unit of time (t). It is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_t = R_0 * S\)</span></p>
<p>Where: <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> = Basic reproduction
number <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> = proportion of
susceptibles in the population</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Effective Reproduction Number, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>: * <strong>Temporal:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> reflects the current situation of
disease transmission and changes over time. *
<strong>Contextual:</strong> Unlike <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>, which assumes a completely
susceptible population, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span>
considers the impact of acquired immunity (by infection or vaccination)
and public health interventions (such as social distancing, quarantines,
and mask use).</p>
<p>Interpretation: * <span class="math inline">\(R_t &gt; 1\)</span>:
The infection is spreading in the population. * <span class="math inline">\(R_t = 1\)</span>: The infection remains stable in
the population. * <span class="math inline">\(R_t &lt; 1\)</span>: The
infection is decreasing and may eventually disappear.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> can be influenced by two
large groups of factors: * Control measures: antimicrobial drugs,
barrier measures (condoms, masks), and contact reduction measures
(isolation, distancing, use of mosquito nets, fumigation, etc.) *
Acquisition of immunity through neutralizing antibodies (reduction of
susceptibles as an epidemic progresses or vaccination).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="contact-rate">Contact Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#contact-rate"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>contact rate</strong> is an epidemiological measure that
describes the frequency with which individuals in a population come into
contact with each other, within a specific time period, in a way that
allows for the possibility of infectious disease transmission. This rate
is fundamental to understanding and modeling the dynamics of disease
spread within a community.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Contact Rate: * <strong>Frequency:</strong>
Reflects the number of potentially infectious contacts per individual in
a given time period. * <strong>Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous:</strong>
The contact rate can be homogeneous, if contacts are distributed
uniformly among all individuals, or heterogeneous, if some individuals
have more contacts than others, which is common in reality. *
<strong>Influence of Factors:</strong> The rate can vary depending on
factors such as age, behavior, environment, and control measures (e.g.,
social distancing).</p>
<p>Calculation of the Contact Rate: The contact rate can be estimated
from empirical data collected through surveys, observational studies, or
inferences from mathematical models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="contact-matrix">Contact Matrix<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#contact-matrix"></a></h2>
<p>A <strong>contact matrix</strong> is an epidemiological tool that
represents the contact rates between different groups in a population,
normally organized by categories such as age, gender, or geographical
location. Each element in the matrix indicates the frequency with which
individuals from a specific group have contact with individuals from
another group.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Contact Matrix: * <strong>Structure:</strong>
It is a square matrix, where rows and columns represent the different
population groups. * <strong>Elements:</strong> Each cell of the matrix
shows the average number of contacts between individuals of the
corresponding groups. * <strong>Data:</strong> Data can be collected
through surveys, observational studies, or inferred from mathematical
models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="latency-period">Latency Period<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#latency-period"></a></h2>
<p>Time interval between exposure to an infectious agent with successful
transmission and the onset of the infectious period. During the latency
period, infected individuals do not transmit the infection.</p>
<p>Examples: * For tuberculosis, the latency period is usually
prolonged, and after contagion, individuals remain without transmitting
the disease for many years. * For SARS-CoV-2 infection, the latency
period was short (2-4 days) and also shorter than the incubation period,
so individuals could transmit the infection before the onset of
symptoms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="incubation-period">Incubation Period<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#incubation-period"></a></h2>
<p>Time interval between exposure to an infectious agent with successful
transmission and the onset of clinical disease (signs and symptoms). For
diseases where the onset of the infectious period coincides with the
appearance of signs and symptoms, the latency and incubation periods are
the same.</p>
<p>Example: * In the study by Wu et al. 2022, a systematic review of the
incubation periods of SARS-CoV2 was conducted. It was found that: the
average incubation period of COVID-19 was 5.00 days (95% CI, 4.94-5.06
days) for cases caused by the Alpha variant, 4.50 days (95% CI,
1.83-7.17 days) for the Beta variant, 4.41 days (95% CI, 3.76-5.05 days)
for the Delta variant, and 3.42 days (95% CI, 2.88-3.96 days) for the
Omicron variant. The findings of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has
continuously evolved and mutated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,
producing variants with different levels of transmission and virulence.
Identifying the incubation period of the different variants is a key
factor in determining the isolation period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="infectious-period">Infectious Period<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#infectious-period"></a></h2>
<p>Time interval during which the infected individual has active
pathogen replication and can transmit it to other individuals. Since
this period can overlap with the incubation period, it can be difficult
to obtain accurate estimates of the infectious period. Viral load and
detection of infectious virus are the two key parameters for estimating
infectivity (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00822-w" class="external-link">Puhach et al.,
2022</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00226-0/fulltext" class="external-link">Hakki
et al, 2022</a>).</p>
<p>Example: * In cases of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza,
SARS-CoV-2) this period can last days, while for diseases like HIV or
tuberculosis it can last years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="recovery-time">Recovery Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#recovery-time"></a></h2>
<p>Time interval between the onset of the infectious period and the
moment an individual stops transmitting the pathogen.</p>
<p>Example: * In cases of chickenpox, subjects stop transmitting the
pathogen when all lesions have crusted over. Therefore, the recovery
period appears before the disappearance of the lesions. After this
period, subjects are considered recovered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="generation-time">Generation Time<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#generation-time"></a></h2>
<p>Time interval between the onset of the infectious period of a primary
case and the onset of the infectious period in a secondary case,
infected by the primary case. It is normally unknown and is approximated
by the serial interval. It cannot be measured, only estimated.</p>
<p>Example: * The study by Hart et al. 2022 in the United Kingdom
between February and August 2021 recruited 227 households with 559
participants. It was found that the Delta variant transmitted faster
than the Alpha variant in households, with a shorter mean generation
time: 4.7 days for Delta versus 5.5 days for Alpha. This suggests that
Delta spreads more rapidly in households due to a rapid decrease in
susceptible individuals, which could make interventions such as contact
tracing and isolation less effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="serial-interval">Serial Interval<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#serial-interval"></a></h2>
<p>Time period between the <strong>onset of symptoms</strong> of a
primary case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary case infected by
the primary case. It is measurable given that data such as dates of
symptom onset can be obtained. This value can be negative when
presymptomatic infection occurs. The distribution of the serial interval
of an infection is commonly used to estimate the distribution of the
generation time (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371" class="external-link">Cori
et al., 2017</a>). The relationship between the serial interval and the
incubation period helps define the type of infection transmission
(symptomatic or presymptomatic) (<a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext#gr2" class="external-link">Nishiura
et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Example: In the study by Nishiura et al. 2020, the serial interval of
COVID-19 was estimated from 28 infector-infected pairs. The onset dates
of disease for primary and secondary cases were analyzed, adjusting for
right truncation because the epidemic was still growing. The results
showed that the median serial interval was 4.0 days in the full dataset
and 4.6 days in the subset of pairs with greater certainty. It is
concluded that the serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter
than its incubation period, suggesting significant transmission before
symptom onset, and is shorter than the serial interval of SARS, which
could introduce bias in calculations based on SARS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="attack-rate">Attack Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attack-rate"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>attack rate</strong> is an epidemiological measure that
describes the proportion of people in a specific population who develop
a disease or infection during a defined period, generally in the context
of an outbreak or epidemic. This rate includes both disease cases and
asymptomatic infections, and may require seroprevalence studies or
mathematical models for accurate calculation.</p>
<p>Characteristics: * <strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluates the proportion
of people who become ill or infected among those initially exposed. *
<strong>Context:</strong> Used to measure the immediate impact of
exposure to an infectious agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="symptomatic-secondary-attack-rate">Symptomatic Secondary Attack Rate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#symptomatic-secondary-attack-rate"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>symptomatic attack rate</strong> measures the proportion
of exposed people who develop clinical symptoms of the disease. It
focuses exclusively on those individuals who present symptoms, thus
differentiating itself from the general attack rate which may include
asymptomatic cases.</p>
<p>Characteristics: * <strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluates the proportion
of exposed people who develop clinical symptoms, providing a measure of
the clinical manifestation of the disease. * <strong>Context:</strong>
Used to understand the severity and clinical impact of the disease in a
specific population.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="secondary-attack-rate-sar">Secondary Attack Rate (SAR)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#secondary-attack-rate-sar"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>secondary attack rate</strong> measures the proportion of
cases that occur among close contacts of primary cases. It focuses on
the secondary transmission of the disease, that is, the spread of the
disease from initial cases to other individuals in close contact.</p>
<p>Characteristics: * <strong>Purpose:</strong> Measures the
transmission of the disease among close contacts of primary cases. *
<strong>Context:</strong> Used to evaluate the effectiveness of control
measures and to better understand the dynamics of disease
transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="herd-immunity-threshold">Herd Immunity Threshold<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#herd-immunity-threshold"></a></h2>
<p>The <strong>herd immunity threshold</strong> is the proportion of the
population that must be immune to an infectious disease, either through
vaccination or previous infection, for the spread of the disease to
decrease and eventually stop. When this threshold is reached, even
non-immune individuals are indirectly protected due to the reduced
probability of pathogen transmission.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Herd Immunity Threshold: * <strong>Critical
Proportion:</strong> Represents the fraction of the population that
needs to be immune to interrupt sustained transmission of the infection.
* <strong>Dependence on R₀:</strong> The threshold is directly related
to the basic reproduction number (<span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>) of the infection, which is the
average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case in a
completely susceptible population.</p>
<p>Calculation: The herd immunity threshold depends on the basic
reproduction number <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and is
defined as <span class="math inline">\(1 - \frac{1}{R_0}\)</span>. The
more contagious a pathogen is, the higher its <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and the greater the proportion of the
population that must be immune to block sustained transmission.</p>
<p>Example: * In the case of measles, for an <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> of 18, herd immunity is approximately
95%.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="overshoot">“Overshoot”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overshoot"></a></h2>
<p>The term <strong>overshoot</strong> refers to the phenomenon in which
the number of cases of an infectious disease exceeds the herd immunity
threshold during an outbreak or epidemic, before disease transmission
decreases and stabilizes. This excess of cases occurs despite a
sufficient proportion of the population having achieved the necessary
immunity to slow the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Overshoot: * <strong>Excess Cases:</strong> Occurs
when there are more cases than expected even after reaching the herd
immunity threshold. * <strong>Temporal:</strong> It is a transient
phenomenon observed before the disease stabilizes or disappears. *
<strong>Herd Immunity:</strong> Indicates that the herd immunity
threshold has been reached but transmission initially continues due to
epidemic dynamics.</p>
<p>Causes of Overshoot: * <strong>Epidemic Inertia:</strong> The disease
continues to spread due to the number of susceptible individuals still
exposed to the infectious agent before transmission is reduced. *
<strong>Heterogeneous Immunity Distribution:</strong> Immunity is not
uniformly distributed in the population, allowing localized outbreaks to
occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="critical-community-size-ccs">Critical Community Size (CCS)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#critical-community-size-ccs"></a></h2>
<p>It is the minimum size of a closed population required for an
infectious agent to persist in that population. If the population number
is too low, after an outbreak the pathogen cannot persist and
disappears. This critical mass of susceptibles is determined by the
characteristics of the agent, the demographic structure, and the
hygienic conditions of the host population.</p>
<p>Example: For measles, which has a high <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>, the CCS is relatively large. Studies
have shown that measles needs a population of at least 250,000 to
500,000 individuals to remain endemic. In contrast, diseases with a
lower <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> may have a much smaller
CCS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="superspreading">Superspreading<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#superspreading"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Superspreading</strong> is a phenomenon in the epidemiology
of infectious diseases where a small number of infected individuals are
responsible for a large proportion of new infections. These individuals,
known as “superspreaders,” infect a much larger number of people than
the expected average, thus accelerating the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Superspreading: * <strong>Variability in
Transmission:</strong> There is great heterogeneity in the ability of
individuals to transmit the disease, with a few individuals causing many
infections while most cause few or none. * <strong>Dispersion Factor
(k):</strong> The degree of superspreading can be quantified using the
parameter k. Low k values indicate high superspreading, while values
close to 1 indicate that the dispersion is more uniform. *
<strong>Specific Context:</strong> Superspreading events usually occur
in specific contexts such as mass gatherings, confined spaces, and
activities where there is prolonged close contact.</p>
<p>Example: During the COVID-19 pandemic, several superspreading events
were observed, such as a single infected person infecting dozens of
people at a religious gathering in South Korea. In another case, a choir
event in the United States resulted in many infections from a single
infected individual.</p>
<p>Example: * In South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic,
superspreading events occurred in the context of religious choirs, with
11 transmission clusters associated with 641 COVID-19 disease cases.</p>

disease spread in its early stages and for planning public health
interventions.</p>
<p>Calculation of the Exponential Growth Rate: The exponential growth

<h2 id="risk-ratio-rr">Risk Ratio (RR)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risk-ratio-rr"></a></h2>
<p>The Risk Ratio (RR), also called Relative Risk, compares the risk of
developing a health event (disease, death) between two groups. It does
so by dividing the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 1
by the risk (incidence proportion, attack rate) in group 2. The two
groups are generally differentiated by demographic factors such as sex
or by exposure to a suspected risk factor, for example, food consumption
or contact with suspected cases.</p>
<p>The formula for the Risk Ratio (RR) is:</p>
<p>Risk of disease (incidence proportion, attack rate) in the primary
group of interest / Risk of disease (incidence proportion, attack rate)
in the comparison group</p>
<p>From this, it can be concluded that: * If RR is equal to 1, it
indicates an identical risk between the two groups. * If RR is greater
than 1, it indicates a higher risk for the numerator group, generally
the exposed group. * If RR is less than 1, it indicates a decreased risk
for the exposed group, which suggests that the exposure may actually
protect against the onset of disease.</p>
<p>Example: * In an outbreak of a respiratory virus among school
students, 28 out of 157 elementary school students developed
tuberculosis, compared to 4 out of 137 high school students. Defining
exposure as being an elementary school student, and non-exposure as
being a high school student, we have:</p>
<table class="table"><thead><tr class="header"><th></th>
<th>Sick</th>
<th>Healthy</th>
<th>Total</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Elementary students</strong></td>
<td>30</td>
<td>120</td>
<td>150</td>

<td>5</td>
<td>135</td>
<td>140</td>
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>Total</td>
<td>35</td>
<td>265</td>
<td>290</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>To calculate RR, first calculate the attack rate for each group:
Attack rate for exposed (Tuberculosis Primary School) = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{30}{150} = 0.2 = 20\%\)</span> Attack rate
for non-exposed (Tuberculosis Secondary School) = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{140} = 0.036 = 3.6\%\)</span></p>
<p>Thus, the RR is simply the ratio of these two risks: <span class="math inline">\(RR = \frac{20}{3.6} = 5.5\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore, elementary school students were 5.5 times more likely to
develop tuberculosis compared to high school students.</p>

<h2 id="odds-ratio-or">Odds Ratio (OR)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#odds-ratio-or"></a></h2>
<p>In case-control studies, the <strong>Odds Ratio (OR)</strong> is used
to compare the odds of exposure to a risk factor between cases
(individuals with the disease) and controls (individuals without the
disease). This measure helps evaluate the association between exposure
and disease.</p>
<p>Odds of exposure among cases / Odds of exposure among controls</p>
<p>It is important to note that the result is not a probability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this number is: * Equal to 1, it means that the
frequency of the event is equal in exposed and non-exposed, meaning
there is no association between exposure and the event. * Greater than
1, it means that the frequency of the event is higher in exposed than in
non-exposed, which means that exposure is a risk factor. * Less than 1,
it means that the frequency of the event is lower in exposed than in
non-exposed, and in this case, it is interpreted as the exposure being a
protective factor.</p>
<p>Example: After an Academic Conference, an outbreak of vomiting and
diarrhea was reported after lunch. Lunch included sandwiches. The total
attendance was 100 people; of whom 50 attendees became ill. During the
initial investigation, it was found that a total of 60 people reported
having eaten the lunch sandwich. Of these 60, 35 became ill, and of the
40 who did not eat the sandwich, 15 reported symptoms of illness.
Summarizing:</p>
<table class="table"><thead><tr class="header"><th></th>

<td>15</td>
<td>25</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr><tr class="odd"><td>Total</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>Calculating, we have that: Odds of exposure in cases: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{35}{15} = 2.33\)</span> Odds of exposure in
controls: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{25}{25} = 1\)</span> Odds
Ratio of exposure (OR) <span class="math inline">\(= \frac{2.33}{1} =
2.33\)</span></p>
<p>This means that the odds of presenting the reported symptoms of
illness due to exposure to sandwich consumption are 2.33 times the odds
of developing these symptoms without having consumed the sandwich. This
can be interpreted as having eaten the sandwich being a risk factor.</p>

<p>The <strong>epidemic curve</strong> is a graphical representation
that shows the distribution of disease cases over time during an
outbreak or epidemic. It is a fundamental tool in epidemiology to
understand the dynamics of an epidemic, identify its origin, evaluate
the effectiveness of interventions, and predict its evolution.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the Epidemic Curve: * <strong>X-axis
(Horizontal):</strong> Represents time (days, weeks, months, etc.). *
<strong>Y-axis (Vertical):</strong> Represents the number of new disease
cases in each unit of time. * <strong>Patterns:</strong> The shape of
the curve can vary depending on how the disease is transmitted and the
characteristics of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Types of Epidemic Curves: 1. <strong>Point Source Curve (or Common
Source Exposure):</strong> * <strong>Characteristics:</strong> Has a
sharp peak followed by a rapid decline. It usually occurs when all cases
are exposed to a common source of infection at a single moment or within
a short period of time. * <strong>Example:</strong> A food poisoning
outbreak at a social event where all cases are exposed to contaminated
food at the same time. 2. <strong>Persistent Common Source
Curve:</strong> * <strong>Characteristics:</strong> The curve shows a
prolonged plateau followed by a drop, indicating continuous or
intermittent exposure to a common source of infection. *
<strong>Example:</strong> A cholera outbreak in a community due to
contaminated water supply that is not immediately corrected. 3.
<strong>Person-to-Person Transmission Curve:</strong> *
<strong>Characteristics:</strong> Shows multiple successive peaks,
reflecting the transmission of the disease from one person to another.
Each peak represents a new generation of cases. *
<strong>Example:</strong> A seasonal flu outbreak, where the first case
infects others, who in turn infect more people, creating several peaks
over time.</p>

<p>Infection is the process in which an infectious agent enters,
develops, and multiplies in the organism of a person or animal. During
infection, an individual can be infectious, meaning capable of
transmitting the agent to others, even if they do not present
symptoms.</p>
<p>Disease, on the other hand, is the state in which an infection
results in the development of clinical symptoms. An individual with
disease is generally infectious, but there may be periods when they are
infectious before showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Example: A person can be infected with the HIV virus and be
infectious without showing symptoms for years. However, when they
develop AIDS, they present severe symptoms. It is crucial to understand
that the infectious agent (like HIV) is transmitted, not the symptoms of
the disease (like AIDS).</p>

<p>Characteristics of Pathogenicity: * <strong>Ability to Cause
Disease:</strong> Not all microorganisms are pathogenic; pathogenicity
indicates whether an organism can cause disease under normal conditions.

not only to infect but also to cause significant harm to the host.
Often, virulence is evaluated in terms of mortality rate, symptom

<p>Characteristics of Virulence: * <strong>Severity of Disease:</strong>
Quantifies the harm a pathogen can cause to the host, including symptom
severity and mortality rate. * <strong>Virulence Factors:</strong>
Molecules and mechanisms that allow the pathogen to invade the host,

<h2 id="natural-resistance">Natural Resistance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#natural-resistance"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Natural resistance</strong> to a pathogen refers to the
inherent ability of an organism to avoid infection or combat an
infectious agent without the need for prior exposure, vaccination, or
treatment. This resistance can be the result of various biological and
genetic characteristics of the host that prevent the entry, replication,
or spread of the pathogen.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Natural Resistance: * <strong>Inherent:</strong>
It is an innate characteristic of the organism, present without the need
for prior exposure to the pathogen. * <strong>Genetic:</strong> Often,
natural resistance is determined by genetic factors that can vary among
individuals and populations. * <strong>Pathogen-Specific:</strong>
Natural resistance can be specific to certain pathogens while others may
not be affected.</p>
<p>Example: In studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, it has been
observed that populations with a high percentage of Duffy-negative
individuals have a very low incidence of <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>
