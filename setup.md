The Introduction to Infectious Disease Modelling for Public Health course was developed by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana for African audiences, as part of the EpiTKit training strategy under the Epiverse Initiative. The course aims to strengthen knowledge and skills in infectious disease modelling and data analysis within the public health context.


## **BACKGROUND**

Enhancing Tools for Response, Analytics and Control of Epidemics in Latin America and the Caribbean (**TRACE-LAC**) is a project funded by the **International Development Research Centre (IDRC)** with the objective of building a **high-quality, open-source, and interoperable data toolkit** for epidemic analytics --- and fostering an engaged user community --- to support decision-makers in responding to epidemics in Latin America.

The **Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Javeriana)** has been supported by **IDRC** to develop various activities and research products within the **TRACE-LAC** project. As part of this effort, Javeriana created the **Epi Training Kit (EpiTKit)**, an **open-access** online training strategy.

The **EpiTKit** consists of a series of modules and units for virtual training in **public health data science** and **infectious disease modeling**, aligned with the **Epiverse initiative** led by **data.org**. To date, **10 units** have been developed in **Spanish**, tailored for audiences in **Latin America and the Caribbean**.

This new phase, developed through a partnership between Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and data.org, with the collaboration of the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, expands the reach of the EpiTKit to Africa through a South-South collaboration. It emphasizes multilingualism and localism in the translation and cultural adaptation of training materials. The initiative aims to strengthen local capacities in data science for public health, while promoting knowledge exchange between regions facing similar gaps and epidemiological challenges.

## **GENERAL OBJECTIVE**

To **translate** and **culturally adapt** the materials of the **Epi Training Kit (EpiTKit)** for the target audience in  Côte d\'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Togo, ensuring **linguistic clarity**, **technical accuracy**, and **cultural relevance**. This initiative embraces a **multilingual** and **localism** approach to create **context-sensitive learning experiences** that reflect **local public health realities** and strengthen regional capacities in data science for epidemic response.

This objective includes:

-   **Translating** and **adapting** the training materials from an initial set of **five units** developed by **Epiverse TRACE-LAC** into **English** and **French**, while integrating **local contexts** and region-specific examples.

-   **Reviewing** technical terminology to ensure consistency, accuracy, and **relevance to local epidemiological landscapes**.

-   **Adapting** and **producing multilingual multimedia resources** that are culturally appropriate and reflective of the diverse realities across African regions.

The five units to be translated and adapted are:

1.  **Introduction to Epidemic Theory**

2.  **General Epidemiology**

3.  **Introduction to Statistics and Probability**

4.  **Parameters**

5.  **Building a Deterministic Model**

## Software Configuration
 
Follow these two steps: 
 
### 1. Install or Update R and RStudio 
 
R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software: 
 
* **R**  is a programming language and software used to execute code written in R.
* **RStudio**  is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R easier. We recommend using RStudio to interact with R.

To install R and RStudio, follow these instructions <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Already Installed? 
 
Wait! This is a great time to ensure your R installation is up to date.
This tutorial requires **R versión 4.0.0 or later**. 
 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To check if your R version is up to date: 
 
- In RStudio, your R version will be displayed in the
 [la ventana de la consola](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html). Or you can run  `sessionInfo()`.

- **- To update R**, download and install the latest version from the [R proiect website](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for your operating system. 
 
  - After installing a new version, you’ll need to reinstall all packages. 
  
  - For Windows, the `{installr}` package can update R and migrate your package library. 

- **To update RStudio**, open RStudio and `click Help > Check for Updates`. If a new version is available, follow the on-screen instructions.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Check for Updates Regularly 
 
While this might sound intimidating, it's **far more common** to encounter issues due to outdated versions of R or R packages. Keeping up with the latest versions of R, RStudio, and any frequently used packages is a best practice.
